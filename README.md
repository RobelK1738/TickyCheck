# Ticky Check

## Generate Reports

This program generates two different reports from the internal ticketing system log file, `syslog.log`. The script `ticky_check.py` will create the following reports:


1. **Ranking of Errors Generated by the System:**
   - This report provides a list of all the error messages logged and the frequency of each error occurrence.
   - The errors are sorted from the most common error to the least common error.
   - This report does not take into account the users involved.


2. **User Usage Statistics for the Service:**
   - This report includes a list of all users who have used the system, along with the number of info messages and error messages they have generated.
   - The report is sorted by username.

To create these reports, follow these steps:


1. Create a Python script named `ticky_check.py`.
2. Use your preferred text editor (e.g., nano or vim) to write the script.

The log file, `syslog.log`, records INFO messages when the service runs correctly. Each INFO message describes the action taken and includes the username and ticket number related to the event. When the service encounters a problem, it logs an ERROR message to `syslog.log`. The ERROR message indicates the issue and states the username that triggered the problematic action.

First:

Import all the Python modules that you'll use in this Python script. After importing the necessary modules, initialize two dictionaries: one for the number of different error messages and another to count the number of entries for each user (splitting between INFO and ERROR).

Second

Now, parse through each log entry in the syslog.log file by iterating over the file.


The script will search and analyze the different types of error messages. The error messages for Ticky provide details about the encountered problems along with timestamps for each occurrence.
